Inspectr
========
This application is running at http://inspectr.thescri.be.

It is a little app for managing subscriptions and inspection results for cadets. It's also part of an assignment for my computer science course at university.

It's written in Rails 2.3 using jQuery for the JavaScript. Please feel free to fork and fiddle.

TODO
====
*Add Edit user details functionality.
*Redo payment controller so it's not completely nuts.
*Add AJAX to the edit cadet stuff.
*Add AJAX to the Make payment screen.
*Make flash messages fade after display.

Add a reports tab for the following reports:

*Report for outstanding Subs
*Report for each inspection
*Graph plotting average inspection mark across the months
*Graph plotting each cadets inspection results across the year.
*Report for all subs payments (optional) to excel.
